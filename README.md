```lrc
[00:16.58] I wonder if it's getting lonely
[00:19.34] In the stars
[00:23.88] My plan was to make it up there
[00:26.44] In the heart
[00:30.84] Dreams have a way of crumbling
[00:34.59] Seems like I'm falling, stumbling
[00:37.79] And I
[00:38.25] Love all the hypocrites
[00:41.14] That say they wanna help
[00:43.01] And then they turn a blind eye, running, running
[01:07.01] 
[00:45.63] Don't say "You'll be alright"
[00:47.86] I hold my crying, screaming, every night and
[00:52.85] I'd rather light a fire beneath
[00:55.25] Than tell you, "I need help, I need you, I'll beg and I'll plead and"
[01:29.75] 
[01:00.70] I got people saying "Phel, look at what you have"
[01:06.16] I don't want it
[01:08.10] Cause all that I wanted was what I'll never have again
[01:12.90] Never gonna win
[01:15.16] Patiently I wait for freedom
[01:22.48] Want my voice but silence seeps in
[01:39.48] 
[01:29.97] Don't say "You'll be alright"
[01:32.22] I hold my crying, screaming, every night and
[01:37.12] I'd rather light a fire beneath
[01:39.57] Than tell you, "I need help, I need you, I'll beg and I'll plead and"
[01:44.66] Don't say "You'll be alright"
[01:47.04] I hold my crying, screaming, every night and
[01:51.96] I'd rather light a fire beneath
[01:54.21] Than tell you, "I need help, I need you, I'll beg and I'll plead and"
[02:28.71] 
[01:59.46] "You should calm down
[02:02.28] You'll be fine, it's nothing"
[02:05.96] It's my life, it's hurting
[02:09.55] Just to dream, while knowing
[02:13.23] It can
[02:14.24] Slip away
[02:16.20] Like moonlight
[02:17.99] Dance and fade in
[02:20.64] New eyes
[02:21.69] Every day there's new eyes
[02:25.14] Living the life I wanted to live, so
[02:43.14] 
[02:28.98] Don't say "You'll be alright"
[02:31.31] I hold my crying, screaming, every night and
[02:36.36] I'd rather light a fire beneath
[02:38.75] Than tell you, "I need help, I need you, I'll beg and I'll plead and"
[02:43.76] Don't say "You'll be alright"
[02:46.02] I hold my crying, screaming, every night and
[02:51.05] I'd rather light a fire beneath
[02:53.43] Than tell you, "I need help, I need you, I'll beg and I'll plead and"
[03:27.93] 
[02:58.52] Don't try talking to me
[03:00.84] I think I'll get accustomed
[03:03.90] To the silence
[03:05.90] Don't try looking for me
[03:08.11] I'm getting lost in, what was
[03:11.12] Lost in silence
